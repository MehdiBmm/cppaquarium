# cppaquarium
C++ interface for the CppAquarium simulator more info can be found on https://openclassrooms.com/forum/sujet/exo-javaquarium-26798 (FR)
The interface is dependent on Gtkmm 3.0.
It contains a compiled application ready for Ubuntu.

Application is 60% finished as I was unable to make the simulation loop because of Gtkmm thread's contraints.
